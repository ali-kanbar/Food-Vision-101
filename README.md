## Features
- **Food Image Classification**: Upload a food image, and the app will classify it into one of the predefined categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web interface built with Flask for ease of use.
- **TensorFlow Integration**: Pre-trained model loaded and served using TensorFlow(the steps for creating the model are in the .ipynb file).
- **Scalable**: Ready for deployment on cloud platforms like Render.

## Installation

To get this project running locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ali-kanbar/Food-Vision-101.git
cd Food-Vision-101
```

### Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Required Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Configuration (Optional)
If you are using environment variables for configurations, ensure to set them in a `.env` file or through your deployment platform.

### Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to interact with the app.

## Usage

1. Open the web application.
2. Upload an image of food.
3. Wait for the classification result to be displayed, showing the predicted food category.

## Model

The model used in this project is a pre-trained deep learning model from TensorFlow, specifically designed for image classification. It has been fine-tuned to classify different types of food with high accuracy.

### Steps to Update the Model
1. Train or fine-tune a model using a food image dataset.
2. Save the model in the `model/` directory.
3. Load the model in `app.py` for inference during runtime.
